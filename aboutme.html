        <h2>About Manish</h2>
		<p>I am Manish Sapkota. Currently I am doing my bachelors in Nami College on Bsc.(Hons) Computing. I live in single family , although there are 5 members in my family.Being the eldest son in a family,I am supposed to be more responsible. Well talking about my nature, I am very much kind and polite. I don't usually lose my temper. I am also very shy depending upon the type of people I meet and depends upon the situation in which I am in. However, I love making new friends. I love spending time with my family and going out with them.

Talking about my interest, If there's any thing that I love doning the most; its playing football. Football has always been my friend since my childhood. I have always dreamed of playing from national football team.I have always recieved Jerseys and a football as my birthday gift from my parents and friends and that has never changed till now. Besides that, dancing ,making friends , visiting new places are my hobbies. I find happiness in every small things but still there are something that I hate or which I don't like. I hate negative and fake people and the people who talk bad things about someone behing his/her back.Also I don't like to go to crowdy places.</p>
